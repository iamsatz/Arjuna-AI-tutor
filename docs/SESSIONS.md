# Arjuna — Work Plan (session-wise)

Sequenced so confirmed P0 fixes ship first, then a safety net, then a sweep for
hidden bugs, then the two big features (Scenario 1 & 3).

Status legend: 🔴 Broken · 🟠 Needs improvement · 🔵 Suggestion · ⚪ Not started · 🟢 Working · ❓ Unverified
Priority: P0 blocks a whole feature · P1 subset/silent · P2 quality/polish · P3 cosmetic

## 🔴 Open — production env vars missing (blocks everything AI/Supabase-backed)

Confirmed via `curl https://arjuna-ai-tutor.vercel.app/api/health`: both
Supabase and Gemini report `not_configured` on production. This is the real
cause behind "AI key not working" and exam creation failing — not a code bug.
Invite links only work because of a file-based fallback specific to invites;
everything else Supabase-backed (exams, curricula, student memory) silently
no-ops.

**Needs to be set in Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**
(Production scope), then redeploy:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` (`https://shikwtguxfhefzvfkedo.supabase.co`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (recommended, for server-side writes)

This requires the account owner — the Vercel CLI in this project is not
logged in here (`vercel whoami` → "specified token is not valid"), so it
can't be set from this session without `vercel login` being run interactively
first. **Never paste real key values into this file or any other committed
file** — set them directly in the Vercel dashboard (or via `vercel env add`
after logging in locally). Re-verify with `/api/health` once set.

## Scenario gaps (from product questions)

- **Multi-subject photo, reads only some** — partial extraction is silent; confidence computed but never shown. → **S5**
- **PDF not understood** — client converts PDF→JPEG; on failure, clean fallback to type/photo each page (handled; polish only). → **S8**
- **Weekly test + 20–30 day revision** — no scheduler at all; manual one-shot only (roadmap text only). → **S6**

## Workflow (standing, applies every session)

1. Automated checks: `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` must be clean.
2. Live click-through: drive the actual dev server (preview tools) through the
   real user flow the session touched, inspect network requests/responses —
   not just "it compiles."
3. Direct push to `main` (Vercel auto-deploys) so your existing production
   links (arjuna-ai-tutor.vercel.app/*) reflect the change — no new preview URLs.
4. After push: a short checklist message — what changed, which of your existing
   links to open, what to tap/check.

## Session detail

### S1 — Restore English tab + Exam key
- `lib/apiClient.ts`: `arjunaFetch` defaults to POST when a `json` body is present.
- Add explicit `method:"POST"` at the 5 English call sites (belt + braces).
- `components/ExamHub.tsx`: route the 6 AI calls (timetable, material, revise×2, quiz×2) through the key-aware helper.
- **Verify:** `/english` (Learn/Words/Journal all work), `/exam` (works with own key in `/settings`).

### S1.5 — Task-based, real-world teaching content redesign
Pedagogy research (task-based learning, inquiry-based scaffolding, gamification effect
size in elementary kids, vocabulary/journaling via personal + imagery) applied to:
- **English concept sessions** (`buildEnglishConceptPrompt`): replace generic "give
  examples from a child's world" with a concrete Indian-kid scenario bank per
  grammar category (school bag labels, tiffin box, cricket team, street food,
  festivals, auto fare) wrapped as a mission the child completes, not a fact recited.
- **Homework teaching method** (`buildSystemPrompt` methodBlock): subject-specific
  real-world task banks (Maths → market/auto-fare counting, Science → everyday
  "why" questions, Telugu/Hindi → festival matching) instead of a static object list.
- **Exam revision & quiz** (`buildExamQuizPrompt`/`buildExamRevisionPrompt`): wrap the
  whole quiz as one escape-room/mission narrative (checkpoints) instead of 4 plain
  MCQs + 1 gamified bolt-on.
- **Daily Words & Journal** (`DAILY_WORDS_PROMPT`, `buildJournalListenPrompt`): tie
  every word/prompt to the child's own recent homework/day, one word per card,
  specific 2-line-answerable prompts instead of generic "write about your day."
- **Verify:** open a concept session, homework teach, exam quiz, and journal —
  each response should reference something a real Indian kid does, not a stock example.

### S1.7 — Exam input parity (upload/scan/type/speak)
Homework already had all four input modes (scan, gallery upload of JPG/PDF/PNG,
type, speak). Exam prep only had camera-only, image-only capture. Brought to parity:
- **Timetable**: new capture screen with Scan (camera) + Choose file (gallery,
  image/PDF, multi-page) + type-the-schedule textarea + 🎤 speak-to-transcribe.
  New backend: `extractExamTimetable` now takes multiple images; new
  `extractExamTimetableFromText` parses typed/spoken schedules directly
  (`lib/gemini.ts`, `lib/prompts.ts`, `app/api/exam/timetable/route.ts` rewritten
  to support multipart multi-photo + JSON text paths).
- **Study material**: added PDF support + gallery picker (was camera-only image),
  client-side PDF→JPEG conversion via existing `prepareUploadFiles`, and a
  🎤 speak-to-topics button feeding the existing "Extra topics" field. Left the
  "generate concept notes from typed topics alone, no material" path out on
  purpose — the app's invariant is concepts only come from what's actually
  uploaded (matches `CONCEPT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT`'s anti-hallucination rule).
- **Verify:** open `/exam` → Timetable — all four options render; typed-schedule
  path reaches the server correctly (live-tested). Material upload's new UI
  verified via code + build; full click-through blocked locally by a pre-existing
  Supabase config gap unrelated to this change (`/api/exam` create already fails
  without the `arjuna_exams` migration — not something this session touched).

### S1.8 — Homework label clarity, curriculum preview+confirm, multi-subject exam create
Direct user testing on production surfaced one critical infra finding and three
real UX gaps:
- **Critical (not code):** `/api/health` on production shows both Supabase and
  Gemini as `not_configured` — confirmed via curl. This is why "AI key not
  working" and exam creation ("upload pages") were failing — Vercel is
  missing `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (and ideally `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
  Invite links still worked only because of a file-based fallback specific
  to invites — everything else Supabase-backed (exams, curricula, student
  memory) silently no-ops. **User action required** — I can't set Vercel env vars.
- **Homework capture tray**: "Type instead" and "Enter myself" looked like
  duplicates. Relabeled to "Type & let Arjuna read it" (AI-parsed) vs
  "Skip AI, add tasks myself" (manual, no AI) — same underlying behavior,
  clearer intent.
- **Curriculum/syllabus upload** (`/settings`): previously extracted and
  saved in one shot with no visibility. Split `/api/curriculum` into a
  `preview=true` extract-only mode and a JSON confirm-save mode; client shows
  selected file names immediately and an "Is this what you uploaded? ✅ Save
  / ✕ Discard" card with the parsed subjects/topics before anything is saved.
- **Exam create flow**: replaced the single subject+date+comma-topics form
  with repeatable subject rows (add/remove), each with its own exam date and
  a topics field with type-or-speak (reused/generalized the `toggleMic`
  helper from S1.7 to take an arbitrary target id + callback instead of a
  fixed two-value union). Submitting loops one `/api/exam` POST per subject.
- **Verify:** live-tested — relabeled buttons render; typed a 2-subject form
  and confirmed two separate `POST /api/exam` calls fired (both correctly
  blocked only by the missing-Supabase-env issue above, not a code bug);
  curriculum preview and confirm-save paths both reach their Gemini/Supabase
  calls correctly (same pre-existing env blockers, not code bugs).

### S2 — Observability + smoke test
- `console.error(realError)` in dev inside every AI `catch` (keep friendly UI text).
- `scripts/smoke.mjs` → POST every `/api/*` route; `npm run smoke`; wire to CI.
- Add a "Verified" state to this tracker.

### S3 — Sweep unverified areas
- Read + test `familyAuth`/`/api/family/*`, TV/`roomSync`, owner dashboard/analytics, curriculum engine (`teachingPlan`, `studentAgent`, `schoolAgent`, `bridgeSubject`, `memory`). Fix any P0 found.

### S4 — Lifecycle & robustness polish
- `TodayRing` reads in `useEffect`; clear celebrate `setTimeout`; harden streak day writes.

### S5 — Scenario 1: smart multi-subject read
- Surface extraction count + confidence; nudge "add the rest if I missed some"; use profile's usual subjects as expectation.

### S6 — Scenario 3: revision scheduler
- Per-child schedule store from term plan → weeks; reuse Vercel cron to auto-generate weekly quiz; spaced-revision queue at 20–30 days; parent reminder via `whatsapp.ts`/email placeholder.

### S7 — Consistency & cleanup
- One AI client everywhere; delete duplicate; drop unused prop; cap journal/daily-words storage.

### S8 — PDF polish + backlog + roadmap
- Use `reason:"pdf_unsupported"` for a sharper tip / per-page retry; update `/roadmap` (Spaced-repetition + Weekly-report → Shipped).

### S9 — School Message Understanding Agent (designed, not yet built)
User wants a separate agent to understand homework AND other school
communications, and to be able to "teach" it over time. Scoped via discussion:
- **Handles:** homework diary (absorbs existing extraction), school
  notices/circulars (new — holiday notices, PTM announcements, fee reminders,
  event circulars — currently no path for these at all), and exam timetables
  (fold in conceptually; S1.7 already built the timetable pipeline).
- **"Teaching" mechanism — learn from corrections over time (chosen over
  upfront-rules-only):** there's no local model to fine-tune here, so
  "teaching" means a persistent per-school memory of corrections fed back into
  future extraction prompts as context — the same shape as the existing
  `teachingPlan.ts` research-once-cache-reuse pattern, applied to message
  understanding instead of invented fresh.
- **Sharing scope — shared per-school (chosen over private-per-family):**
  reuses the existing `schoolKey` mechanism (school+grade+board). One
  family's correction improves extraction for every other family at that
  school immediately.

**Architecture:**
1. One classifying entry point (`/api/school/understand`): parent scans/
   types/speaks anything from school; a lightweight classifier prompt sorts
   it into homework / notice-circular / exam timetable, then routes to the
   matching specialist extractor.
2. New notices/circulars pipeline: new prompt producing
   `{type: holiday|ptm|fee|event|other, title, date, summary, actionNeeded}`,
   surfaced in a new **School Inbox** card on the Homework tab (this is
   backlog item "School comms inbox" from the roadmap — direct alignment).
   Same capture tray (scan/upload/type/speak) as everywhere else for consistency.
3. The teaching loop: parent corrects a task/notice in the review screen (the
   diff between what the agent produced and what the parent finalized is
   currently thrown away — this session captures it); log the correction to
   a new `arjuna_school_corrections` Supabase table keyed by `schoolKey`;
   periodically (every few corrections) one Gemini call distills the raw
   correction log into a compact ~5-10 rule ruleset per school, cached and
   reused (mirrors the teaching-plan cache); every future extraction for that
   school includes the latest learned rules automatically.

**Size/risk note:** needs a new Supabase table/migration (the one genuinely
hard-to-reverse piece — write the SQL for the user to run, don't apply it
autonomously), 2 new API routes, one new prompt set, a correction-diff hook
wired into the existing review screens, and a new Inbox UI. Comparable in
size to S6 (revision scheduler). Not started — awaiting a go-ahead to build.
